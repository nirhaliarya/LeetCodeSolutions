//This is the Solution for the LeetCode Question (2) Add Two Numbers in Python3

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Create a dummy head node to simplify list construction
        dummy_head = ListNode(0)
        current = dummy_head
        carry = 0

        # Iterate while there are still digits in either list or a carry exists
        while l1 or l2 or carry:
            # Get the value of the current digit from l1 (or 0 if l1 is exhausted)
            val1 = l1.val if l1 else 0
            # Get the value of the current digit from l2 (or 0 if l2 is exhausted)
            val2 = l2.val if l2 else 0

            # Calculate the sum of current digits and carry
            total_sum = val1 + val2 + carry

            # Determine the new carry and the digit for the current node
            carry = total_sum // 10
            digit = total_sum % 10

            # Create a new node with the calculated digit and append it to the result list
            current.next = ListNode(digit)
            current = current.next

            # Move to the next nodes in l1 and l2 if they exist
            if l1:
                l1 = l1.next
            if l2:
                l2 = l2.next

        # Return the head of the resulting linked list (skipping the dummy head)
        return dummy_head.next
